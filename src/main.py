    """
    Dummy main function for testing Ruff and Pydocstyle linting rules.
    
    This function serves as a placeholder where users can input their own code
    to test various linting validations including:
    - Ruff code quality checks
    - Pydocstyle documentation standards
    - Type annotation requirements
    - Code complexity rules
    
    Users should replace this dummy implementation with their actual automation
    logic while maintaining proper documentation and code quality standards.
    
    Returns:
        None: This function serves as an entry point and doesn't return values.
        
    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: If users forget to replace this dummy implementation.
